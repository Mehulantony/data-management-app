# Data Management App
## A brief description of the project

###### This Python application uses data from a text file which contains information about student exam data.
###### For this, a Student class is created which provides relevant details regarding a student's ID, name,
###### test scores, and average score calculation. The class includes public instance methods and a private
###### instance method. Furthermore, we also define two functions, updateName and updateTest, prompting the
###### user to enter a student's first and last names, and to also enter test scores for the student respectively.
&nbsp;  
###### Key features of this project include file I/O, data management, user interaction and object-oriented design.
